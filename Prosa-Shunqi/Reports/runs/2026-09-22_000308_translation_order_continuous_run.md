# Translation-order continuous run

Run started: **2026-09-22 00:03:08 +08:00**.

This report summarizes the current continuous execution across source files.
It does not replace canonical per-file reports or the machine-readable
manifests under `Validation/planning/v06_pipeline/`.

## Starting machine state

- Authoritative source: Prosa v0.6 commit
  `414e66760333eaa4ef78c685bcf53291c527a548`.
- Target environment: Lean 4.33.1, Mathlib
  `0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`, Rocq 9.3.
- Accepted files: 11 / 357.
- Accepted declarations: 106 / 2439.
- Translated but not certified: 0.
- First READY unfinished file: Rank 12, `util/sum.v`.
- `util/sum.v` starting status: 3 / 25 accepted; its direct dependencies
  `util/nat.v`, `util/notation.v`, and `util/rel.v` are accepted.

## Progress log

### 2026-09-22 00:03:08 +08:00 — Sum contract and representation audit

- Read the formal execution order, translation skill, report policy, current
  status/manifest, mapping policy, and authoritative v0.6 source.
- Confirmed all 25 elaborated source declarations and retained the existing
  three accepted interval theorems as the starting cluster.
- Classified the remaining work into reusable sequence/filter, interval,
  partition, and finite-witness semantic clusters.
- Began the sequence/filter cluster with stable Lean helper interfaces for
  ordered sequence sums, filtered sums, filtered maxima, and the Boolean
  subsequence computation. These are explicitly Lean helpers, not additional
  source coverage claims.
- No new declaration is accepted at this point. Fresh compilation,
  actual-artifact export/import, correspondence certificates, assumption
  audit, and publication remain pending.

### 2026-09-22 00:09:12 +08:00 — First 13 Sum candidates proof-clean

- Added Lean candidates for the authoritative declarations from
  `sum_nat_eq0_nat` through `eq_sum_leq_seq`, preserving source order.
- Introduced four validation-facing Lean helpers—`sumSeq`, `sumFiltered`,
  `maxFiltered`, and `subseqb`—that expose the source's ordered-list,
  multiplicity-preserving computations. They are marked `LEAN_HELPER` and do
  not count as source declaration coverage.
- Resolved the remaining induction/elaboration obligations in
  `ltn_sum_leq_seq` and `eq_sum_leq_seq`. A direct pinned-environment command,
  `lake env lean Prosa/Util/Sum.lean`, now succeeds for the current file.
- This is translation/proof progress only. The source snapshot is not yet
  frozen and these 13 declarations are not accepted until actual-artifact
  export/import, correspondence proofs, assumption audit, and publication
  succeed.

### 2026-09-22 00:21:13 +08:00 — Whole Sum Lean candidate complete

- All 25 authoritative `util/sum.v` declarations now have Lean counterparts
  in source order. The last cluster covers equal-sized intervals, partitioned
  sums, filtered monotonicity, `Unit`, interval pigeonhole counting, and the
  two-distinct-unit-witness lemmas.
- `lake build Prosa.Util.Sum` passed under the pinned toolchain. The production
  source hash is
  `57497c4f2411a16582a95cd8992456178d6791e442f70f4365c2c1cd93f53361`;
  the resulting project `.olean` hash is
  `93694c6e11cfc9c3f616473425022f334a526eb96f365ee14dca613ec929797c`.
- A fail-closed `#print axioms` audit covered all 25 source counterparts. All
  passed the existing allowlist (`propext`, `Quot.sound`, and
  `Classical.choice` where actually used); no `sorryAx` or custom axiom was
  found. Audit summary hash:
  `e47de1e0f7fba8cf581d5f8413bba7b328070aeb2a90f552dabf49fef46e2375`.
- This closes translation and Lean proof reconstruction, not semantic
  acceptance. The 22 new targets now enter frozen-snapshot actual-artifact
  export/import and correspondence certification; the published baseline
  remains 3/25 until that gate succeeds.

### 2026-09-22 01:17:54 +08:00 — Actual-artifact sequence bridge and first certificates

- Added a validation-only computation interface for the actual compiled
  `Prosa.Util.Sum` artifact. Its kernel equations expose ordered list
  `filter`, `map`, `length`, Boolean `all`/`any`, list sum/max, and the three
  recursive `subseqb` cases without replacing the production definitions.
- Fresh `lean4export` and `rocq-lean-import` succeeded for this frozen Sum
  snapshot. Export SHA-256:
  `8e0c9a484ef63a54cc8b42a83263a7f1223ae166f9f8b7067cb30b72ec717fab`;
  imported `.vo` SHA-256:
  `b39d296602389b295890c723689ac2b704db6440b8b3506b92bf6e6c7aa0b4a8`.
- Added the reusable `SumSequenceCorrespondence.v` layer. It now certifies
  namespace-local imported List/Bool/Nat representation, membership,
  predicate filtering, length, Boolean folds, ordered sequence sums,
  filtered sums/maxima, and the actual imported `subseqb` equations.
- The first two independent theorem-statement correspondences,
  `sum_nat_eq0_nat` and `sum_nat_gt0`, compile in Rocq. Separate exact-type
  guards bind those structural statements to the actual imported theorem
  types; the semantic certificates themselves do not use either source or
  target theorem proof constant.
- These two remain **pending publication** until the fail-closed assumption
  classifier and target/source self-dependency audits pass. The canonical
  accepted count therefore remains 3/25 at this checkpoint.

### 2026-09-22 01:38:41 +08:00 — Nine sequence theorem correspondences compiled

- The assumption audit for `sum_nat_eq0_nat` and `sum_nat_gt0` passed
  fail-closed: no semantic premise, no source/target theorem dependency, and
  no unexpected assumption. Both require only the declared Prop/SProp
  foundation plus importer foundations.
- Reusable proposition combinators were added for implication, pointwise
  membership/predicate/order obligations, Boolean Nat equality, subsequence
  truth, filtered-sum order/equality, and predicate monotonicity.
- Independent Rocq certificates and exact imported-type guards now compile
  for nine of the thirteen sequence/filter theorems:
  `sum_nat_eq0_nat`, `sum_nat_gt0`, `sum_majorant_constant`,
  `bigmax_leq_sum`, `sum_le_subseq`, `leq_sum_subseq`, `leq_sum_seq`,
  `eq_sum_seq`, and `leq_sum_seq_pred`.
- The remaining four in this cluster are the Boolean partition split,
  duplicate-free subset sum, strict pointwise sum, and equality-under-bound
  theorem. Publication is intentionally deferred until their shared cluster
  audit is complete; accepted Sum coverage is still 3/25.

### 2026-09-22 02:29:32 +08:00 — Partition-sum correspondence layer closed

- The earlier thirteen sequence/filter theorem certificates were completed,
  fail-closed audited, and published as the 16/25 Sum checkpoint (the original
  three interval certificates plus thirteen new sequence certificates).
- The actual-artifact export was then deliberately expanded, without changing
  production `Sum.lean`, to include the next six compiled theorem types and
  the production `sumOfPartition` / `sumOverPartitions` computation equations.
  The expanded export hash is
  `8ab4c41eed5588a3992de8e8376a06fa0bbcfa7ee36414259580d871320ec9be`;
  its imported Rocq object hash is
  `9dc607fc4587a18072eb163b45e7b305adc749a8d59766763970b597d1edc7a1`.
- Added reusable, actual-body-bound correspondences for nested partition
  sums, the coverage predicate, equality/disequality filters, and
  `uniq`/`Nodup`. These close `sum_over_partitions_le`,
  `reorder_summation`, and `sum_over_partitions_eq` by composition rather
  than by invoking either side's theorem proof.
- All three semantic certificates, their separate exact imported-type guards,
  and marked `Print Assumptions` modules compile in Rocq 9.3. The automatic
  classifier reports for each: no semantic premise, no source/target theorem
  self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption. Their current status is
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`, pending the next cluster publication
  pass. Thus 19/25 are now kernel-checked on the current semantic work path,
  while the formally published aggregate remains 16/25 until republished
  against the expanded artifact hashes.

### 2026-09-22 02:48:45 +08:00 — Higher-order, Unit, and witness Sum targets closed

- `sum_leq_mono` now composes a reusable higher-order relation for Nat
  endofunctions and indexed function families with certified monotonicity and
  filtered ordered-sum correspondence. This tests correspondence under
  higher-order function arguments without following the Lean proof graph.
- `sum_unit1` now relates Rocq `unit` to the actual imported Lean `Unit` and
  connects MathComp's finite one-element bigop to the exact imported
  `Finset.univ` sum expression. The target computation reduces in the imported
  artifact; the audit explicitly accounts for the standard imported
  `Classical_choice`, `Quot_sound`, and `propext` foundations used by the
  Finset representation.
- `sum_ge_2_seq` now composes `uniq`/`Nodup`, pointwise unit bounds, ordered
  sequence sums, nested existentials/conjunctions, disequality, membership,
  and Boolean equality-to-one. The source elaborates its `2 <= sum` premise as
  `1 < sum`; the bridge records and proves the corresponding Lean `2 <= sum`
  boundary rather than assuming syntactic identity.
- All three certificates and exact imported-type guards compile in Rocq 9.3.
  Their automatic audits report `semantic_premises=[]`, source/target theorem
  self-dependency `false`, and `unexpected=[]`; each is
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`.
- Current actual-artifact work-path progress is therefore 22/25. The remaining
  three declarations are the interval cluster
  `big_sum_eq_in_eq_sized_intervals`, `pigeonhole_on_interval`, and
  `sum_ge_2_nat`. Formal publication still awaits the final whole-file gate.

### 2026-09-22 03:24:30 +08:00 — All 25 Sum correspondences kernel-check

- The last three interval certificates now compile against the actual freshly
  imported artifact: `big_sum_eq_in_eq_sized_intervals`,
  `pigeonhole_on_interval`, and `sum_ge_2_nat`.
- A reusable interval layer now handles arbitrary related endpoints and Nat
  functions (not only canonical source-generated target functions), plus
  artifact-local Bool predicates, Bool-to-Nat counting, conjunction,
  truncated subtraction, reflected equality-to-one, and related existential
  Nat witnesses.
- Separate exact-type guards definitionally bind all three semantic shells to
  the imported compiled Lean theorem constants. Source guards bind the
  extracted official v0.6 statements; notably, the MathComp Bool-to-Nat
  coercion in `pigeonhole_on_interval` was checked by Rocq reduction rather
  than assumed from printed syntax.
- The fail-closed `Print Assumptions` classifier reports for all three:
  `semantic_premises=[]`, source theorem dependency `false`, target theorem
  dependency `false`, and `unexpected=[]`. Each theorem is
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`.
- This raises the current actual-artifact work path to **25/25** semantic
  certificates. Formal file acceptance is not yet claimed: the expanded
  interval and sequence artifacts still require the clean whole-file
  regression/publication gate against their current hashes.
- The generic theorem-type exporter was also hardened with an opt-in mode that
  projects finite-sum subexpressions while preserving unrelated reducible
  logical/computational structure. Six Lean-kernel `Eq.refl` guards and
  `Meta.isDefEq` checks bind that normalization to the compiled theorem types;
  the tooling patch and rebuilt binary are content-addressed in the workspace.

### 2026-09-22 03:37:19 +08:00 — `util/sum.v` formally accepted

- Both current-snapshot publication gates completed from isolated fresh work
  directories: the six interval declarations and all nineteen sequence,
  filter, partition, higher-order, Unit, and witness declarations.
- The sequence run rebuilt the pinned Lean dependency chain and validation
  computation interface, exported the 19 exact compiled theorem types and
  six actual definition interfaces, imported the artifact into Rocq 9.3,
  compiled every correspondence/type/audit module, and published only after
  the fail-closed classifier and frozen-baseline audit passed.
- Published hashes include interval export
  `b5c74781c14175c6df1649380e8e86912757a975e07b0ce06121df3fbf870483`,
  interval import
  `896098c0eecff17d2db632ec232d56003458a5fb66404aff26ccc8e3072cb320`,
  sequence export
  `8ab4c41eed5588a3992de8e8376a06fa0bbcfa7ee36414259580d871320ec9be`,
  and sequence import
  `3050dc00d1f7dc06cf95c7b60db8b44ec7297f99a39cd8b5a7a9c3701ad01e45`.
- Every source declaration has a production counterpart, proof-clean Lean
  theorem, actual-artifact certificate, exact-type/source fidelity evidence,
  and accepted assumption audit. All theorem certificates have empty semantic
  premises, false source/target self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption.
- Machine status is now `util/sum.v = ACCEPTED_V06_FILE`, **25/25**;
  cumulative project coverage is **12/357 files** and **128/2439
  declarations**, with `translated_but_not_certified = 0`.

### 2026-09-22 03:44:33 +08:00 — `util/epsilon.v` notation interface accepted

- Rank 13 has zero named public declarations but was not accepted merely as
  0/0. The official source and fresh production module were both compiled,
  and each notation was materialized at Nat through a validation-only
  interface.
- The actual compiled Lean interface was exported and imported into Rocq; the
  kernel accepted `epsilon_notation_value_certificate`, relating the official
  `(ε : nat)` expansion to the imported Lean `(ε : Nat)` value.
- The assumption audit is `CERTIFIED`, with no Prop/SProp foundation,
  semantic premise, theorem self-dependency, or unexpected assumption.
- The production representation remains notation-only, avoiding the extra
  named constant present in the historical translation. Machine coverage is
  now **13/357 files** and **128/2439 declarations**.
## 2026-09-22 04:22:47 — `util/bigop.v` accepted

- Confirmed rank 14 / layer 0 readiness from the authoritative file DAG.
- Added the v0.6 production translation `Prosa/Util/Bigop.lean` without
  copying a historical file; the source declaration is new in v0.6.
- Preserved the full non-commutative `Monoid.law` boundary by exposing the
  operation, associativity, and both identity laws. The `bigSeq` helper is a
  source-order Bool-filtered right fold, not a `Finset` reformulation.
- Fresh build/export/import run:
  `Validation/.work/runs/translation_order_bigop.Acs6tY`.
- `big_pred1_seq_statement_certificate` was accepted by the Rocq kernel.
  Audit result: `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`; semantic premises =
  none; source theorem dependency = false; target theorem dependency = false;
  unexpected assumptions = none.
- Published `bigop_module_manifest.json` and `bigop_module_status.json`.
- Cumulative state: 14/357 accepted files, 129/2439 accepted declarations,
  translated-but-not-certified = 0.

### 2026-09-22 04:49:13 +08:00 — `util/setoid.v` accepted

- Translated and validated all three named public declarations: the Boolean
  implication inductive `leb`, its characterization lemma `leb_eq`, and the
  reflected-Nat-order conversion definition `leqRW`.
- Preserved `leb` as its own indexed relation rather than conflating it with
  Lean's `Setoid` or order classes. Source anonymous rewriting instances are
  represented by named Lean helper facts and do not inflate source coverage.
- Fresh build/export/import run:
  `Validation/.work/runs/translation_order_setoid.CYSzjH`.
- Added reusable Bool truth, implication/Iff, constructor-level `leb`, and
  reflected/Coq/Lean Nat-order correspondences. A local proof error exposed
  the directionality of MathComp `leP`; swapping `introT` and `elimT` closed
  the bridge without any new premise.
- All three fail-closed assumption audits report
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`, empty semantic premises, false
  source/target self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption.
- Published `setoid_module_manifest.json` and `setoid_module_status.json`.
- Cumulative state: 15/357 accepted files, 132/2439 accepted declarations,
  translated-but-not-certified = 0.

### 2026-09-22 05:24:23 +08:00 — `util/poet.v` accepted

- Added the new v0.6 theorem
  `forall_exists_implied_by_forall_in_zip`; its Lean proof uses an accepted
  zip/member interface and passed proof-clean audit with only `propext` and
  `Quot.sound`.
- Actual-artifact probing exposed an important universe issue: monomorphic
  validation equations imported a duplicate `List_inst1`. Explicit
  polymorphic universes made the equations refer to the target theorem's
  exact imported `List`, with no production change.
- Added reusable correspondence for ordered lists, length, pairs, zip,
  membership, Bool `all`, and higher-order Bool/Prop predicates, then composed
  these into the theorem-statement certificate.
- Full official `util/list.v` compilation under Rocq 9.3 overflowed in the
  unrelated `last0_cons` proof. The automatically generated source signature
  therefore uses the pinned elaborated `Check` type and records omission of
  the irrelevant `Require Export prosa.util.list.` import; the theorem
  statement itself is unchanged.
- Fresh build/export/import run:
  `Validation/.work/runs/translation_order_poet.sIjAZW`.
- The fail-closed semantic audit reports
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`, no semantic premise, no source or
  target theorem self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption.
- Cumulative state: 16/357 accepted files, 133/2439 accepted declarations,
  translated-but-not-certified = 0.

## 2026-09-22 05:30:20 — rank 17 `util/bigcat.v` started

The current machine state identified rank 17 `util/bigcat.v` as the earliest unfinished READY file. All three direct internal dependencies (`list`, `notation`, and `tactics`) are accepted. The authoritative file contains 13 lemmas spanning ordered half-open Nat interval concatenation, finite ordinal concatenation, sequence-indexed concatenation, filtering, uniqueness, cancellation, and partition coverage. Whole-file translation has started; no Bigcat declaration is counted as accepted yet.

## 2026-09-22 05:47 — Bigcat Lean snapshot frozen

The complete 13-declaration production candidate now compiles under the pinned Lean toolchain. All declarations passed fail-closed `#print axioms` classification with only the approved Lean logical foundations (`propext`, `Quot.sound`, and where actually used `Classical.choice`). No declaration is yet counted as accepted: export/import and semantic certificates remain outstanding.

## 2026-09-22 06:14 — Bigcat artifact boundary stabilized

- Pinned-source extraction and elaborated-type checks cover all 13 declarations.
- A naive `size_big_nat` export exposed a concrete importer scalability issue;
  no result from that abandoned run was published.
- Generic subexpression normalization, checked by Lean `Meta.isDefEq`, reduced
  the export to 143,647 bytes and allowed Rocq 9.3 to import the complete target
  signature.  The next gate is a kernel `Eq.refl` normalization guard.
- The actual imported theorem-type probe now passes, including the finite
  ordinal record and all List/Bigcat interfaces.  This remains progress
  evidence, not final acceptance.

## 2026-09-22 06:47:47 — first Bigcat semantic proofs compile

- Added and kernel-checked a reusable artifact-local sequence/Bigcat
  correspondence layer (Bool, equality, List, membership, append, filter,
  flatMap, Bigcat, Nodup, length and logical combinators).
- Four independent theorem-statement certificates compile:
  `mem_bigcat`, `mem_bigcat_exists`,
  `bigcat_filter_eq_filter_bigcat`, and
  `seq_different_elements_nil`.
- The proofs structurally transport statement components and do not use the
  imported target theorem or official source theorem proof.  Final target-type
  guards and fail-closed publication remain outstanding, so coverage is still
  16/357 files and 133/2439 declarations.

## 2026-09-22 07:11:40 — Bigcat validation reaches 7/13 compiled certificates

- The Lean-kernel `Eq.refl` guard now independently binds the actual compiled
  `size_big_nat` type to the exporter-normalized type after a successful
  `Meta.isDefEq` check.
- The Rocq common library now proves the actual imported half-open Nat interval
  Bigcat computation relation by interval-length induction and production
  equations; this closes the principal operation-level dependency for five of
  the six remaining declarations.
- Seven of thirteen structural statement-correspondence certificates compile:
  `mem_bigcat`, `mem_bigcat_exists`,
  `bigcat_filter_eq_filter_bigcat`, `seq_different_elements_nil`,
  `bigcat_seq_uniqK`, `bigcat_uniq`, and `bigcat_partitions`.
- No Bigcat declaration is published yet.  The next work is to compose the Nat
  interval certificates, add the ordinal enumeration correspondence, and run
  exact-type/self-dependency/assumption audits for all thirteen declarations.

## 2026-09-22 08:02:30 — Bigcat reaches 13/13 compiled semantic proofs

- All thirteen independent source-to-actual-target statement certificates now
  compile in Rocq 9.3.
- The remaining Nat interval statements compose the previously certified
  half-open interval operation bridge and normalized interval-sum value.
- The ordinal case adds a reusable MathComp ordinal / imported Lean `Fin`
  payload relation and canonical-enumeration Bigcat correspondence.
- A proof interface using `List.ofFn_succ'` was discarded because it caused
  exporter/importer proof-graph blow-up; the checked core `List.ofFn_succ`
  equation gives the same required computation interface with a tractable
  artifact.
- Coverage is deliberately still 16/357 files and 133/2439 declarations:
  exact-target guards and the fail-closed whole-file audit have not yet been
  published.

## 2026-09-22 08:14:09 — Bigcat semantic audit closes cleanly

- All 13 actual-target specialization guards compile.
- The guard work exposed and corrected one validator-side expression mismatch
  for `bigcat_filter_eq_filter_bigcat`; the revised target encoding now uses
  the actual imported `List.filter` expression and reuses the certified filter
  correspondence.
- Automated `Print Assumptions` classification gives 13/13
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`, no semantic premise, no source or
  target theorem self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption.
- A fresh full validation/publication run is the last gate.  No acceptance
  totals are incremented before that run succeeds.

## 2026-09-22 08:23:54 — `util/bigcat.v` accepted

- The final validator ran from fresh isolated work directory
  `translation_order_bigcat.UnNizx`; no preflight `.olean` or `.vo` was reused.
- Fresh Lean build, normalization guard, export, source extraction, Rocq
  import, all certificates, exact-target guards, proof audits, baseline audit,
  and content-addressed publication passed.
- All 13 declarations are `ACCEPTED_V06_TRANSLATION` and
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`, with no semantic premise, no
  source/target theorem self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption.
- Cumulative state is now 17/357 accepted files and 146/2439 accepted
  declarations; translated-but-not-certified remains zero.
- The next READY unfinished file by approved order is rank 18
  `util/minmax.v`.

## 2026-09-22 08:25:37 — rank 18 `util/minmax.v` started

All four direct internal dependencies are accepted, so the file is DAG-ready.
Its ten declarations concern conditional maxima over ordered sequences and
canonical finite ordinal ranges.  Six historical candidates require v0.6
signature adaptation and four declarations are new.  In particular, the old
propositional-predicate `foldl` helper will not be copied as specification;
the current plan uses a Boolean conditional `foldr Nat.max 0`, closely
matching the source big-operator computation and the approved List/Bool
representations.

## 2026-09-22 08:36:39 — Minmax Lean translation reaches 10/10

- All ten public declarations compile in the pinned Lean environment.
- The candidate retains Bool predicates, ordered Lists, zero identity, and a
  validation-friendly `foldr Nat.max` computation.
- A private maximum-witness lemma is reused by three production proofs; it is
  a proof implementation detail, not additional source coverage or semantic
  evidence.
- No Minmax declaration is counted accepted until proof-clean and fresh
  actual-artifact semantic validation finish.

## 2026-09-22 10:35:27 — `util/minmax.v` accepted

- Completed all ten production translations and Lean proofs, including the
  v0.6-only witness/subset group and the informative `reflect` theorem.
- Fresh actual-artifact export/import and ten independent Rocq correspondence
  certificates passed. The shared operation layer covers conditional maximum,
  Bool existential, ordinal/Fin enumeration, and Nat maximum/order.
- The automatic assumption audit classified all ten as
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`; semantic premises and unexpected
  assumptions are empty, and source/target theorem self-dependencies are
  false.
- Published `minmax_module_manifest.json` and
  `minmax_module_status.json`. Cumulative state is now 18/357 files and
  156/2439 declarations, with zero translated-but-not-certified debt.

## 2026-09-22 10:39:19 — rank 19 `util/div_mod.v` started

Both direct file dependencies (`util/nat.v` and `util/subadditivity.v`) have
valid accepted-file evidence, so the file is DAG-ready. The complete 15-item
contract was read from the pinned source. Twelve items require new translation
and three are adaptations of credible historical candidates. The first
preflight focuses on a reusable actual-artifact correspondence for natural
division, remainder, divisibility, ceiling division, and truncated
subtraction; no DivMod coverage is claimed yet.

## 2026-09-22 11:27:51 — validation workflow optimization regression passed

- Translation work was paused before DivMod semantic publication; its 15 Lean
  candidates compile, but 0/15 are accepted and cumulative coverage remains
  18 files / 156 declarations.
- The project skill now requires common-bridge lookup, parameterized or
  generated artifact adapters, config-driven incremental
  `prepare/check/finalize`, seven-stage timing/cache evidence, and reuse of
  audited exporter/importer patterns.
- A generic content-addressed driver and state engine were added. The cold
  Sum/Poet/Bigcat prepare spent 100.29 s in the isolated Lean build. Repeating
  the same snapshot executed no prepare stage, verified four cache groups in
  0.019 s, and retained exact output hashes.
- One generated Rocq adapter template was instantiated against the actual
  imported Sum, Poet, and Bigcat datatypes. Eighteen roundtrip/truth/membership
  assumption checks passed; six expected truth/membership checks expose the
  existing Prop/SProp foundation, while none has a semantic premise or an
  unexpected assumption.
- Existing semantic results (25 Sum + 1 Poet + 13 Bigcat) and their acceptance
  gates were unchanged. A first failed finalize was retained as evidence: it
  found an ambiguous `True` marker and a shell hook error-propagation flaw,
  and no result was published until both were corrected.

## 2026-09-22 13:14:02 — DivMod semantic DAG closes in Rocq

- Added a reusable quotient/remainder/divisibility correspondence layer that
  works from the imported computation interface rather than unfolding the
  large `Nat.brecOn` implementation.
- All 15 declaration certificates and all exact imported-type guards compile
  in Rocq 9.3. The fail-closed classifier reports no semantic premise, no
  source or target theorem self-dependency, and no unexpected assumption.
- A publication preflight correctly rejected an incomplete Lean axiom-audit
  configuration for the two computation definitions. Both definitions were
  added to the audit; `div_floor` is axiom-free and `div_ceil` transparently
  records its standard `propext` dependency.
- Coverage remained 156/2439 until a new content-addressed prepare/finalize
  run could bind these proofs to current artifacts.

## 2026-09-22 13:26:13 — `util/div_mod.v` accepted

- Fresh snapshot
  `f525d2797714840b193125320d10766d3165655c9bfdf996e2bb42cd31593c8c`
  passed Lean build, official-source acquisition, actual Lean export, and Rocq
  import. Stage times were 46.648 s, 3.701 s, 9.991 s, and 2.718 s.
- The check and finalize runs hash-verified and reused all four prepared
  stages. Final certificate compilation, audit, and publication passed in
  5.864 s, 0.125 s, and 0.372 s respectively.
- All 15 declarations are `ACCEPTED_V06_TRANSLATION` and
  `CERTIFIED_WITH_PROP_SPROP_FOUNDATION`; semantic premises and unexpected
  assumptions are empty and source/target self-dependencies are false.
- Cumulative state is now 19/357 files and 171/2439 declarations, with zero
  translated-but-not-certified debt. Rank 20 `util/nondecreasing.v` is the
  next READY unfinished file.

## 2026-09-22 15:09:20 — Nondecreasing artifact import unblocked

- The 33/33 compiled, proof-clean Lean candidates remain unpublished while
  semantic certificates are built.
- Root isolation showed that `List.getD`, not `distances` or theorem proof
  bodies, triggered the large import closure. Guarded normalization reduced it
  to `Option.rec` over `List.get?Internal`.
- A per-universe-instance importer fix now generates the Type recursor for
  concrete `Option Nat`; the isolated lookup and the complete normalized
  33-target artifact both import successfully.
- The complete import also confirmed that Rocq needs the existing 65,520 KiB
  stack setting; the earlier exit 139 at `Char.ofNat` disappears with that
  setting. Four normalized production/interface bodies have kernel-checked
  Lean guards. Coverage is intentionally unchanged at 171/2439 until the Rocq
  correspondence and assumption gates close.

## 2026-09-22 17:14:18 — Nondecreasing source and base operation layer closed

- The pinned v0.6 source extractor was hardened for Unicode declaration names
  and active Section notation. It now acquires and Rocq-compiles all 33 exact
  declarations: three computational bodies and 30 proof-omitted exact
  statements with elaborated-type evidence.
- A stale validation-interface `.olean` was detected and explicitly rebuilt.
  The corrected 499,500-byte export retains real proof bodies for five
  computation equations while making only the 30 business theorems
  statement-only. Its Rocq import succeeds under the approved importer patch.
- The imported `nthD` equations no longer pull the original Lean/Mathlib proof
  dependency graph into the semantic assumptions. The generated artifact
  adapter plus Nat/List operation certificate now kernel-check roundtrip,
  order, length, and zero-defaulted lookup correspondence with no semantic
  premise. Formal coverage deliberately remains 19/357 files and 171/2439
  declarations pending definition and theorem-statement closure.
