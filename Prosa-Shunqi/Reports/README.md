# Reports

## Canonical file reports

Each authoritative Prosa v0.6 source file has at most one current report at:

```text
Reports/files/<source-directory>/<first-report-timestamp>_<source-basename>.md
```

Once work starts on a source file, its translation batches, blockers,
revalidation runs, fixes, and final acceptance are appended to that file's
canonical report. The leading timestamp is copied from the earliest historical
report that covered the source file, uses no timezone suffix, and is not
changed on later updates. Do not create another report for the same source
file. File existence is not acceptance; the machine-readable status and
manifest files under `Validation/planning/v06_pipeline/` remain authoritative.

## Current proof progress

On the active Rocq-9.0 baseline, machine-published acceptance is **11 / 357
source files** and **103 / 2439 public declarations**, with **0
translated-but-not-certified**. Rank 1–11 passed fresh actual-artifact import,
all semantic certificates, assumption classification, and `rocqchk`. The
latest formal batch result is
[`rocq90_full_migration_batch2.md`](migrations/rocq90_full_migration_batch2.md).

Rocq-9.3 acceptance for later files is retained as historical provenance but
does not make a predecessor READY under the active baseline. The next READY
work is rank 12, `util/sum.v` (25 authoritative declarations); it was not
started in Batch 2.

The formal scheduling document is
[`../v06_file_translation_order.md`](../v06_file_translation_order.md).
Dependency readiness still comes from the accepted file DAG, not from report
text.

## Validation workflow optimization (2026-09-22 11:27:51 +08:00)

The translation skill and workspace validator now make incremental validation
the default for subsequent files. A content-addressed `prepare → check →
finalize` driver binds source, production dependencies, toolchain, exporter /
importer binaries, options, module-loading configuration, and every prepared
output hash. Certificate-only changes reuse verified Lean/export/import
artifacts; relevant input changes generate a different snapshot, while absent
or corrupt cache entries fail closed. Every run records execution count,
cache mode, elapsed time, input fingerprint, and output hashes for all seven
validation stages.

Repeated artifact-local Bool, `eqType`/`DecidableEq`, ordered `seq`/`List`,
roundtrip, and membership proofs can now be generated from one audited Rocq
template. The generated file still names the exact imported artifact and is
kernel-compiled and assumption-audited; this is proof reuse, not a new trust
assumption. Export modes for statement-only types, computation equations,
body projections, guarded normalization, and universe-sensitive datatype
interfaces are also catalogued behind a common config-driven helper.

Regression on existing accepted Sum (25), Poet (1), and Bigcat (13) results
passed without changing their semantic status or acceptance gates. The cold
isolated Lean build took 100.29 s; the identical prepare rerun had four cache
hits, zero stage executions, and took 0.019 s. The final generated-adapter
compile/audit/publication check took 4.24 s. One intentionally retained failed
attempt records an initially ambiguous audit-marker sort and exposed a hook
error-propagation bug; publication remained blocked until both were fixed.

This optimization changes workflow only. Accepted coverage remains **18 / 357
files** and **156 / 2439 declarations**. `util/div_mod.v` remains an
unaccepted 15-declaration Lean candidate while its actual-artifact semantic
validation is paused at the user's requested optimization boundary.

## Legacy and raw evidence

`Reports/legacy/` retains the former date-named, multi-file, and batch reports
with their original bytes. Canonical reports record each legacy filename and
hash. Intermediate PASS entries in a legacy report remain intermediate; only
the later publication gate can establish final acceptance.

Raw machine logs and intermediate evidence belong under `Validation/logs/`,
not here.

## Continuous-run summaries

Cross-file execution summaries requested for a specific run live under
`Reports/runs/`. They record chronological progress and final outcomes for
that run, but never override canonical per-file reports or machine-readable
pipeline status. Current run:
